# Abraham-Lincoln-Bridge
This page contains a layout of two maps comparing before and after, a link to an animation showing key viewpoints of the bridge, and a Cesium Ion Story. The goal of this project is to explore a successful bridge construction project in Kentucky.


The Abraham Lincoln Bridge reached substantial completion at the end of 2015 and opened December 6th of that year. It has 2 spans, with a total length of 2,100 feet. It began as a two way bridge, but now carries traffic northbound in six lanes. It connects Jeffersonville, Indiana to Louisville, Kentucky.

The maps were created using ArcGIS Pro with knowledge and help from the Department of Geography at University of Kentucky.

I am Sam L. and this is my final for GEO 409. I am a civil engineering student that took this class as an elective because I am interested in GIS and my mother works with GIS.
